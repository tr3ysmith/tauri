### Tauri's Environment Variables

This is a documentation of all environment variables used by tauri core crates and tauri CLI.

### Tauri CLI

These environment variables are inputs to the CLI which may have an equivalent CLI flag.

> if both environment variable and CLI flag are used, the CLI flag will have priority.

- `TAURI_PATH_DEPTH` — Number of levels to traverse and find tauri configuration file.
- `TAURI_DEV_SERVER_PORT` — Port to use for the CLI built-in dev server.
- `TAURI_DEV_WATCHER_IGNORE_FILE` — A `.gitignore`-style file to control which files should be watched by the CLI in `dev` command.
- `TAURI_SKIP_DEVSERVER_CHECK` — Skip waiting for the frontend dev server to start before building the tauri application.
- `TAURI_SKIP_UPDATE_CHECK` — Skip checking for a newer CLI version before exiting the CLI process.
- `TAURI_TRAY` — Set this var to `ayatana` to use `libayatana-appindicator` for system tray on Linux or set it `appindicator` to use `libappindicator`.
  - For `deb` bundle target, the CLI will add the appropriate package as a dependency, if unset, the CLI will default to `ayatana`.
  - For `appimage` bundle target, the CLI will copy the appropriate package to the appimage. if unset, the CLI will make a guess based on what package is installed on the developer system.
- `TAURI_FIPS_COMPLIANT` — Specify WiX `FipsCompliant` option
- `TAURI_PRIVATE_KEY` — Private key used to sign your app bundles
- `TAURI_KEY_PASSWORD` — The private key password, see `TAURI_PRIVATE_KEY`
- `APPLE_CERTIFICATE` — Base64 encoded of the `.p12` certificate for code signing. To get this value, run `openssl base64 -in MyCertificate.p12 -out MyCertificate-base64.txt`.
- `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` — The password you used to export the certificate.
- `APPLE_ID` — The Apple ID used to notarize the application. If this environment variable is provided, `APPLE_PASSWORD` must also be set. Alternatively, `APPLE_API_KEY` and `APPLE_API_ISSUER` can be used to authenticate.
- `APPLE_PASSWORD` — The Apple password used to authenticate for application notarization. Required if `APPLE_ID` is specified. An app-specific password can be used. Alternatively to entering the password in plaintext, it may also be specified using a '@keychain:' or '@env:' prefix followed by a keychain password item name or environment variable name.
- `APPLE_TEAM_ID`: Developer team ID. If your Apple ID only belongs to one team then you don’t need to supply a Team ID. However, it’s best practice to include it regardless. That way, joining another team at some point in the future won’t break your notarization workflow. To find your Team ID, go to the [Account](https://developer.apple.com/account) page on the Apple Developer website.
- `APPLE_API_KEY` — Alternative to `APPLE_ID` and `APPLE_PASSWORD` for notarization authentication using JWT.
  - See [creating API keys](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi/creating_api_keys_for_app_store_connect_api) for more information.
- `APPLE_API_ISSUER` — Issuer ID. Required if `APPLE_API_KEY` is specified.
- `APPLE_API_KEY_PATH` - path to the API key `.p8` file. If not specified, the bundler searches the following directories in sequence for a private key file with the name of 'AuthKey_<api_key>.p8': './private_keys', '~/private_keys', '~/.private_keys', and '~/.appstoreconnect/private_keys'.
- `APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY` — The identity used to code sign. Overwrites `tauri.conf.json > tauri > bundle > macOS > signingIdentity`.
- `APPLE_PROVIDER_SHORT_NAME` — If your Apple ID is connected to multiple teams, you have to specify the provider short name of the team you want to use to notarize your app. Overwrites `tauri.conf.json > tauri > bundle > macOS > providerShortName`.
- `CI` — If set, the CLI will run in CI mode and won't require any user interaction.

### Tauri CLI Hook Commands

These environment variables are set for each hook command (`beforeDevCommand`, `beforeBuildCommand`, ...etc) which could be useful to conditionally build your frontend or execute a specific action.

- `TAURI_ARCH` — Target arch, `x86_64`, `aarch64`...etc.
- `TAURI_PLATFORM` — Target platform, `windows`, `macos`, `linux`...etc.
- `TAURI_FAMILY` — Target platform family `unix` or `windows`.
- `TAURI_PLATFORM_TYPE` — Target platform type `Linux`, `Windows_NT` or `Darwin`
- `TAURI_PLATFORM_VERSION` — Build platform version
- `TAURI_DEBUG` — `true` for `dev` command, `false` for `build` command.
- `TAURI_TARGET_TRIPLE` — Target triple the CLI is building.
